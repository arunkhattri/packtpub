    "When we say that a function takes <span style='color:FF7F50'>O(1)</span> time, it means that it generally only takes <span style='color:FF7F50'>1 step </span> to execute. Similarly, a function with <span style='color:FF7F50'>O(n)</span> time would take <span style='color:FF7F50'>n steps </span> to execute, where n is generally the size (or length) of the object. This time complexity is just a basic indication of what to expect when executing the code, as it is generally what matters most.\n",

    "* $\\color{#FF7F50}{O}$ Big Omicron: The upper bound/worst-case scenario.\n",
    "* $\\color{#FF7F50}\\Omega$ Big Omega: The lower bound/best-case scenario.\n",
    "* $\\color{#FF7F50}\\Theta$ Big Theta: The tight bound, which means both $\\color{#FF7F50}{O}$ and $\\color{#FF7F50}{\\Omega}$ are identical."
